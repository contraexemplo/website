	<h1>Open source community sign up</h1>

	<p>Thank you for your interest in mentoring Outreachy interns! We're excited to have you part of the program.</p>

	<p>Please fill out the form below to sign up your community ({{ participation.community.name }}) to participate in the {{ participation.participating_round.official_name }}.</p>

	<h2>Estimated number of interns</h2>

	<p>Please list the maximum number of interns your community has mentoring capacity to accept.
	</p>

	<p>How many interns (max) does your community believe you have the volunteer resources to accept this internship cohort? Outreachy requires a 1:1 mentor to intern ratio. We encourage co-mentoring for a 2:1 mentor to intern ratio. We encourage communities who are new to Outreachy to only accept one or two interns.
