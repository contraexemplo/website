Hi folks,

Outreachy's call for mentoring communities is now open. Will {{ community.name }} be able to participate in the {{ current_round.internstarts|date:"F Y" }} internship cohort?

We also wanted to let communities know some bad news -- donations to Outreachy have been greatly reduced in the past two years. Unfortunately, we may have to reduce Outreachy program activities unless we find additional funding.

Do you have a contact at any companies or grant makers that might be interested in sponsoring Outreachy program activities? While we often find sponsors who want to donate towards internships with specific FOSS communities, it is harder to find sponsors who are willing to donate towards the labor-intensive work of running Outreachy. Let us know if you have any sponsorship leads.

I also wondered if your community might be willing to donate an additional amount to the Outreachy program activities fund? Any additional donation will help close our funding gap.

I hope we can work together to ensure a future for Outreachy -- a future where people who face discrimination and systemic bias become open source leaders.

Let us know if you have ideas for potential Outreachy sponsors, or other opportunities to fund Outreachy program activities.
