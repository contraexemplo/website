    <a href='#mentor-duties'>Who makes a good Outreachy mentor?</a>
  </h2>
  <p>The heart of Outreachy is our volunteer mentors. Mentors work directly with Outreachy applicants and interns.</p>
  <p>
    Outreachy looks for mentors who are <i>helpful, patient, welcoming, and kind</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Mentor time commitment:</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      {{ current_round.contributions_open|date:"F j" }} to {{ current_round.contributions_close|date:"F j" }}: Mentors spend <b>5 to 10 hours per week</b> during the applicant contribution period.
    </li>
    <li>
      {{ current_round.internstarts|date:"F j" }} to {{ current_round.internends|date:"F j" }}: Mentors spend <b>5 hours per week</b> during the internship period.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Mentors will need to provide an internship project description. Outreachy does not allow applicants to submit project ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is okay for mentors to submit multiple project ideas. Communities with sponsorship for one intern tend to list 1 to 3 projects. Some communities list as many as 5 to 7 projects.
  </p>
  <p>Outreachy encourages co-mentoring! Co-mentoring is when two or more people mentor the same Outreachy intern.</p>
  <p>Mentors will need to provide a list of tasks for applicants to work on during the contribution period.</p>
