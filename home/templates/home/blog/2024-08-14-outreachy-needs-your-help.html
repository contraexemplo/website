  <h2>Outreachy's Legacy</h2>
  <p>
  In the span of Outreachy's 14-year journey, Outreachy has reached some amazing goals:</p>
  <ul>
	  <li><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/blog/2024-01-11/outreachy-2023-in-review/">1,000 interns have participated in Outreachy</a></li>
	  <li>133 open source communities have mentored Outreachy interns</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Outreachy internships have been an inclusive and welcoming introduction to open source for people who face systemic bias or discrimination in the technology industry of their country.
  </p>
  <p>Outreachy does much more than introduce people to open source. Outreachy also helps the open source community retain people from marginalized groups:
  </p>
  <ul>
	  <li>After their internships, <b>80% of past Outreachy interns continue to contribute to open source.</b></li>
	  <li>Among Outreachy interns who are employed, <b>44% of Outreachy past interns contribute to open source as part of their job.</b></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Outreachy's Future</h2>
  <p>
    Outreachy's future is bright, but our pathway to that future is becoming foggy. Like many diversity and open source initiatives, we are facing financial challenges, and we need the open source community's help and support.
  </p>
  <p>There are several ways you can help support Outreachy:</p>
  <ul>
	  <li><a href="#mentor">Mentor Outreachy interns</a></li>
	  <li><a href="#grants">Help us find grants</a></li>
	  <li><a href="#corporate-sponsorship">Talk to your employer about becoming an Outreachy sponsor</a></li>
	  <li><a href="#individual-donations">Make an individual donation to Outreachy</a></li>
	  <li><a href="#fundraiser">Promote Software Freedom Conservancy's fundraiser</a></li>
	  <li><a href="#stories">Share stories about Outreachy's impact</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We are optimistic about facing these challenges together. We believe that we need a collective effort from the whole open source community to improve our chances of overcoming these financial challenges. We want to raise the alarm early and ask for help, so that we aren't forced to make any sudden decisions on our own.
  </p>
  <h3>Outreachy Funding</h3>
  <p>
    Finding funding for Outreachy has been extremely difficult this year. Funding for Outreachy comes from a variety of sources: open source community funds, non-profits, academic institutions, corporate sponsors, individual donors, and grants. This year, Outreachy donations are down across all sources of funding.
  </p>
  <h3>Outreachy internship funding</h3>
  <p>Outreachy requires open source communities to secure funding for at least one Outreachy intern ($8,000 USD).</p>
  <p>
    In more recent rounds, due to generous grants, Outreachy was able to waive the requirement to provide internship funding for humanitarian and open science communities. Instead, these internships were funded directly from the Outreachy core activities fund. During the pandemic, we decided to fund additional internships with all types of mentoring communities. Our goal was to give much needed remote opportunities during a time when COVID-19 vaccines were a distant dream.
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, Outreachy only funded a few internships directly from our core operating budget. Our largest internship cohort ever (May 2021 cohort) had 71 interns, with only 8 of the internships funded from the Outreachy core activities budget. A year later, with the help of a large grant, Outreachy accepted 67 interns, with 22 interns funded from the Outreachy core activities budget. By the May 2023 cohort, Outreachy was funding over half our internships directly from our core activities budget.
  </p>
  <h3>Grants</h3>
  <p>
    This year, several of Outreachy's grants have reached the end of their grant period. While the Outreachy team has applied to many different grant opportunities, none have been confirmed as of August 2024.
  </p>
  <p>
    This leaves a funding gap for Outreachy's core program activities. The Outreachy core activities fund covers the cost of running the internship program, which includes all of the logistics of this complex program, as well as promoting open source to marginalized groups in tech, supporting interns, and advising mentors from open source and open science communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outreachy is currently run by a small team of <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/contact/contact-us/">five paid Outreachy organizers</a>, who guide 80 to 130 internships per year. We are proud that two of the Outreachy organizers are former Outreachy interns. The Outreachy organizer team is dedicated to ensuring the Outreachy application and internship periods run smoothly, and improving the program to promote inclusivity and equity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outreachy has budget reserve to continue paying our core team right now. We are committed to having dedicated staff to support applicants, interns, mentors, and open source community coordinators.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, without incoming funding for Outreachy's core program activities, we worry about the future of our Outreachy organizer team. Outreachy internships are a high-touch, very interactive experience that requires oversight. Every cohort, there are a few internships that require advice or intervention to get back on track. Some of the issues that arise are ones that require great care and attention to handle properly. The dedication of the team in supporting both interns and mentors has ensured a 96% internship completion rate. Reducing the time Outreachy organizers spend on running the program will have detrimential impacts to both applicants, interns, and mentors.
  </p>
  <h3>Corporate sponsorship</h3>
  <p>
    Outreachy has also faced financial challenges in other areas. As a result of the financial uncertainty in the tech industry, may companies have reduced or cut open source financial support from their budget. Outreachy has been similarly impacted, as the total corporate donations we receive has decreased in the last two years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly impacted are open source communities who rely on corporate financial support. Many communities who traditionally mentor Outreachy interns have not been able to find funding for those internships. As they have lost corporate funding, they have increasingly asked for Outreachy to fund their internships directly from our core activities fund.
  </p>
  <p>
  The open source community has also been impacted by the financial uncertainty in the tech industry. Many of the employers of open source contributors have announced budget cuts or layoffs. This creates an atmosphere of uncertainty, where people are afraid to lose their jobs. This means many former Outreachy mentors who would normally participate are struggling with precarious employment situations. This means finding Outreachy mentors is very hard, even when an open source community does have funding for an Outreachy internship.
  </p>
  <h3>Fiscal outlook</h3>
  <p>
    The tech industry financial uncertainty has a triple impact on Outreachy: Outreachy is receiving less corporate donations, the demand for Outreachy to directly fund internships with our participating communities has increased, and open source communities who have internship funding can't find mentors because community members are facing unstable employment situations. Coupled with the end of several large grants, this means Outreachy's budget is very reduced.
  </p>
  <p>
    We know Outreachy is not alone in experiencing decreased donations. Other diversity in tech programs are also struggling. After 17 years, <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2024/07/08/girls-in-tech-shut-down-adriana-gascoigne.html"
    target="_blank">Girls in Tech shut down</a> quite suddenly due to lack of funding in addition to Women Who Code and other similarly situated programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outreachy will work to avoid such scenarios and safeguard the stability of our organization. We have cut our conference travel and applicant promotion budget. We have also made tough decisions regarding the number of internships we can fund from Outreachy's core budget. We worry about the impact of our decisions on Outreachy applicants, and we also need to manage our resources prudently to mitigate any adverse impacts on our operations.
  </p>
  <h3>Decreased internship cohort sizes</h3>
  <p>
  With our budget constraints in mind, the Outreachy team made the tough decision to drastically decrease the number of internships in the May 2024 cohort. Our May internship cohorts are typically our largest cohorts, ranging from 50 to 70 interns. While Outreachy had mentor capacity to accept 47 interns for the May 2024 cohort, we only had the budget capacity to accept 35 interns.</p>

  <p>
  Without your help, Outreachy internship cohorts will stay small, around 30 to 40 interns at least through 2025.
  </p>
  <p>
    We don't want to detract from our amazing internship cohort! However, given recent news of other open source foundations and diversity initiatives announcing their closures, we want to be transparent about the challenges Outreachy is facing.
  </p>
  <h2>How can I help?</h2>
  <p>
    We hope to face these challenges with the support of the amazing open source community, our corporate sponsors and grant makers, and all of the people who have participated in Outreachy. Together, we can face these challenges, weather the storm, and emerge more resilient than ever.

  </p>
  <p><u><b>Promoting Outreachy intern stories</b></u></p>
  <p>
    If you are a past Outreachy intern, we want to hear about your journey! You are welcome to write about any aspect of Outreachy's impact on you. If you need any help brainstorming things to write about, you can ask yourself the following questions: Where were you before your Outreachy internship? What path did you take after your internship? What challenges have you faced? How did the skills you learned during Outreachy help you on your journey? How did working with an Outreachy mentor and open source community change your life? Then use the answers to create your story, and share it via social media, blog post, video, or whatever format works for you. If you don't feel comfortable sharing it on social media or would rather share it anonymously, you can reach out to us and we can post your story.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also encourage open source communities to write about the contributions of past Outreachy interns. You can talk about an Outreachy intern's contribution during their internship, or a past Outreachy intern's contributions after their internship. We are especially interested in hearing about the journey of Outreachy past interns to become key contributors, community leaders, and open source advocates.
  </p>
  <p><u><b>Promoting Outreachy's impact on open source communities</b></u></p>
  <p>
    We also encourage past Outreachy mentoring communities to write about the impact Outreachy had on your open source community. Perhaps the Outreachy application process was an eye-opening way to see how your community's new contributor processes could be improved. Maybe your community learned more inclusive practices from an Outreachy organizer or another Outreachy mentoring organization. Perhaps your community was one that was transformed by continued involvement by former interns. There is no impact that is too small! We are so excited to hear how Outreachy has impacted your open source community.
  </p>
  <p><u><b>Sharing Outreachy mentors' stories</b></u></p>
  <p>
    For past Outreachy mentors, we encourage you to talk about how Outreachy has impacted you personally. Perhaps Outreachy helped you improve your communication or collaboration skills. Maybe your experience as an Outreachy mentor has improved how you mentor coworkers in your job. Perhaps working with an Outreachy intern opened your eyes to a different perspective and different experiences of people around the world. Maybe you found personal joy and satisfaction in watching your Outreachy intern take on new challenges, learn and grow. Outreachy is so interested to hear how people find meaning and purpose by volunteering as Outreachy mentors.
  </p>
  <p><u><b>Join the fundraising discussion</b></u></p>
