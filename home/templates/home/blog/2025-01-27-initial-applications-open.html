<h2 id='non-student-eligibility'><a href='#non-student-eligibility'>👩🏾‍💻 Non-student eligibility policy</a></h2>

<p>
You do not have to be a student to apply to Outreachy!
Outreachy is open to people who are not students.
</p>

<p>
You do not need a university degree to apply to Outreachy.
Many Outreachy interns learned their skills through online resources.
</p>

<p>
Please read our full <a href="{% url 'eligibility-information' %}#rules">eligibility guidelines</a>.
</p>

<h2 id='student-eligibility'><a href='#student-eligibility'>👩🏿‍🏫 Student eligibility policy</a></h2>

<p>
Outreachy has some special eligibility rules for students.
If you are (or will be) a student, please read the sections below.
</p>

<h3 id='hemisphere-rules'><a href='#hemisphere-rules'>Which cohort should students apply to?</a></h3>

<p>
Outreachy runs twice a year, May to August and December to March.
</p>

<p>
Students in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a> should apply to the June 2025 internship cohort.
</p>

<p>
Students in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere">southern hemisphere</a> should apply to the December 2025 internship cohort.
</p>

<p>
We consider India to be in the northern hemisphere, regardless of where the university is located.
Otherwise, if your university is near the equator, you are welcome to apply to either cohort.
</p>

<h3 id='graduating-students'><a href='#graduating-students'>What if I'm graduating?</a></h3>

<p>If you are completing your last term for your degree, you are only eligible for the internship cohort designated to students of the hemisphere where your school is located.</p>

<h3 id='no-student-policy-exceptions'><a href='#no-student-policy-exceptions'>Do you grant exceptions to these policies?</a></h3>

<p>In order to apply our policies fairly, we do not grant exceptions to the student policies listed above.</p>

<p>When determining student eligibility, Outreachy considers the hemisphere of the school's location. We do not consider the individual student's course load. We do not consider special arrangements students have made with their university. Students who plan on taking a school term off to pursue an internship are not eligible for Outreachy. We cannot accept letters from universities about pausing classes or joining classes at a later date.</p>
