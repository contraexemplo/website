<p>While we encourage any open source project to apply to Outreachy, we ask all communities to help Outreachy find donors to cover at least one intern (${{ current_round.sponsorship_per_intern|intcomma }} USD per intern). This includes both the internship stipend ($7,000 USD) we pay to interns, as well as an internship administrative fee ($1,000) to cover some of basic costs of running the Outreachy program.</p>

<p>We have <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/blog/2024-08-14/outreachy-needs-your-help/">very limited funds</a> available to fiscally support Outreachy internships with specific open source communities. If your community does not have budget for one intern, and you cannot help Outreachy find a donation lead, you can apply for the Outreachy program to fiscally support Outreachy interns working with your community. We understand that open source communities often face short-term financial issues, and Outreachy may be able to help, depending on our overall budget and priorities. Please <a href="{% url 'contact-organizers' %}">contact us</a> to discuss this further.</p>
